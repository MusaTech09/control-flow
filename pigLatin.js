//Pig Latin is a fun take on the English language where you move any consonant cluster from the start of the word to the end of the word; when words begin on a vowel, you simply add "-yay". Vowels are "aeiou".
//Write a function pigLatinWord that takes in a word string and translates the word into Pig Latin. For this problem use the [String's slice()][slice] method. The slice() method extracts a section of a string and returns it as a string.

console.log(pigLatinWord("apple")); //=> "appleyay"
console.log(pigLatinWord("eat")); //=> "eatyay"
console.log(pigLatinWord("banana")); //=> "ananabay"
console.log(pigLatinWord("trash")); //=> "ashtray"
